        <h3>How did it start?</h3>

        <p style="color:lightgrey;">Ice Hockey is thought to have began in the 18th and 19th centuries within Britain and Ireland, evolving from simple stick and ball games. 
            The North American sport, lacrosse was also thought to have contributed to the development of Ice Hockey. 
            The first recorded public indoor Ice Hockey game took place in the Victoria Skating Rink of Montreal in 1875 with rules highly similiar to field hockey. 
            Many of these early games had teams from universities and were often very violent.  
            The game of Ice Hockey has been refined over the many years, developing more and more rules to keep the game interesting and humane.</p>

        <p>In the early games of undeveloped Ice Hockey, the goaltender did not have any specialised equipment. 
            Leg pads were eventually adopted in order to protect the goaltenders legs. 
            The earliest leg pads evolved from cricket pads which were made of leather and stuffed with deer hair.
            In the 1930s the leg pads were further developed, becoming wider and thicker.
            The pads eventually had additional rolls added onto them and synthetic leather paired with high density foam started to take over.
            Around the 2000s, 'box' style leg pads became more popular as the 'butterfly position' became more known and used.</p>

        <p>Face protection was not used by goaltenders in a game until 1930 when Clint Benedict wore an American football nose-guard to protect his broken nose.</p>
            Clint did not continue to wear the mask after his injury.
            Jacques Plante was the first goaltender to wear a mask 'full-time' and in 1959 he began wearing it outside of practices in a game.
            The first masks designs were named face huggers as they would cover the entire face and attached directly onto your skin with eye and mouth holes cut in. 
            Small holes were cut into the masks to help with ventilation.
            Some goalies prefered to wear player helmets which were plastic and had inner foam with a metal bar cage. 
            Danglers (curved sheet of plastic) were sometimes attached to these helmets for additional protection around the clavical area.
